This is just a simple little python script to generate a random flag set for the Final Fantasy 1 randomizer.

There are a few flags that don't match up with the rest of the codebase, so it's a bit ugly. 

And it'll generate some hellaciously disgusting flagsets.

usage: generator.py [-h] [-b] [-d] [-e] [-l] [-m] [-o OUTFILE] [-s] [-t] [-x]

options:
  -h, --help          show this help message and exit
  -b, --blind         Make it a blind seed
  -d, --deepdungeon   Enable the possibility of Deep Dungeon
  -e, --experimental  Enable the experimental tab
  -l, --levels        Enable the Max Level Slider and Starting level dropdown
  -m, --mp            Enable max MP randomization
  -o OUTFILE, --outfile OUTFILE
                      Path where you want the output file dropped. Default is current working directory
  -s, --shopkill      Enable shop kill chances
  -t, --transmoog     Enable possible transmooglifier
  -x, --xp            Allow per class XP randomization

It will output a file called FF1R(unix timestamp).json. Take that on over to https://finalfantasyrandomizer.com,
scroll down to the "Load from JSON" button, and go to town. 

There are certain guard rails in place, as well as some of the standard QoL things that people are used to. If
you want to change any of the guardrails themselves, just modify the "guardRails.json" file.

I take no responsibility for damage to your sanity for using this.

Requirements: python3 (written and tested with 3.10.12), PythonGit, and an internet connection

#To Do:
Get the flag dependencies enabled
Figure out Why the spoiler bats return so many extra counts.
