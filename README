This is just a simple little bash script to generate a random flag set for the Final Fantasy 1 randomizer.

It's simple. It's ugly. And it'll generate some hellaciously disgusting flagsets.

I'll probably get around to re-writing it in python eventually. Until I do though, I'm just going to keep using bash to do it.
