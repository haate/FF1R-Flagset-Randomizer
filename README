This is just a simple little bash script to generate a random flag set for the Final Fantasy 1 randomizer.

It's simple. It's ugly. And it'll generate some hellaciously disgusting flagsets.

I'll probably get around to re-writing it in python eventually. Until I do though, I'm just going to keep using bash to do it.

Usage: ./generator.sh [-h] [-w NumberFrom0-100] [-b]

        -h      help: print this help and exit.
        -w      tristate weight percentage as an interger: If unset, will default to 33. This is the percentage chance that a flag
                that can roll tristate will roll tristate. So, if you set this to 67, then it will be a 67% chance that a tristate 
                flag will roll as unknown, and a 16.5% chance that it will roll either yes or no each.
        -b      bistate only: Will disable the tristate option entirely. This *should* override the -w flag.
        -f      output file: Where you want the output file to land. If left empty, it will be placed in the working directory with a filename
                of YYYYmmDDHHMMSS-random.json. If you're specifying a file path, please put it in quotation marks."
        
Please note: If you try running it using `sh generator.sh`, and you're using Ubuntu, it will fail because Ubuntu's default `sh` command 
links to `dash` rather than `bash`, and dash doesn't support the use of the `declare` function.

Other known issues: Sometimes, you will get a `Preset Load Failed` when importing the json. This is because some of the
flags don't quite mesh with what I thought they were. If that happens, please open an issue with the error text pasted in, so
I can fix it up.

Currently, it will only work with the 4.1.6 version (https://4-1-6.finalfantasyrandomizer.com). I am working on updating it
to work with the 4.2.0 version currently (and reworking how it runs overall).
*Further note: it will work with the 4.2.0 version, though the site will throw some warning messages (non fatal). Use on 4.2.0 does,
currently at least, not include any of the new flags. Yet.
